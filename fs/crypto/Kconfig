	  Enable encryption of files and directories.  This
	  feature is similar to ecryptfs, but it is more memory
	  efficient since it avoids caching the encrypted and
	  decrypted pages in the page cache.  Currently Ext4,
	  F2FS and UBIFS make use of this feature.

	help
	  Enable legacy method to generate aes keys derived
	  from nonce and master key. In private mode the keys
	  will be use as file encryption keys and set into
	  inline crypto engine hardware.
